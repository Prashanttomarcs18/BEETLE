        <p>Chopta is located in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand and lies on the Ukhimath – Chamoli – Gopeshwar road. Distance of Chopta from Haridwar is 225 kms and the distance from Ukhimath to Chopta is around 29 kms. To simplify the reaching part, let me start from Delhi. Chopta is located at an altitude of approx. 2650m.</p>
         
      <p>Distance from Delhi to Haridwar is 225 kms and has regular buses from ISBT Kashmere Gate & Anand Vihar ISBT. Time taken to cover the distance is usually 5-6 hours. There are three kinds of buses from Delhi to Haridwar; normal buses, Janrath buses (AC) and Volvo buses (AC). It is recommended to take a 10 pm or 10:30 pm bus so that you reach Haridwar bus stand at around 4 am in the morning.
      </p>
       <p> Haridwar to Chopta : If you reach Haridwar at 4 or 5 in the morning, there may be quite a confusion with regards to buses for Kund at the bus stand. In the absence of a proper information channel, no one will deny about the availability of a bus, nor will anyone tell you where and how it goes from.
      </p>
       <p> Based on my experience, a humble suggestion – Do not waste time wandering here and there at the Haridwar bus stand. The earliest buses on the route to Chopta leave from GMOU bus stand (pronounced geemu), which is a 500m walk away from main Haridwar bus stand on the left side once you exit the gates. GMOU stands for Garhwal Mandal (Bus) Operators’ Association. GMOU bus stand is on the opposite side of the Railway Godown.</p>
      <p>There will be no direct buses for Kund or Ukhimath. So basically one needs to get into one of the below GMOU buses :

        03:15 am – Joshimath (Get down at Rudraprayag) and change buses                                                                      05:00 am – Badrinath (Get down at Rudraprayag) and change buses                                                                  05:15 am – Gaurikund or Kedarnath (Get down at Kund) shared sumo                                                    07:45 am & 08:00 am – Joshimath & Badrinath (Rudraprayag) and change buses</p>
      <p>Breakfast place in the bus is at a dhaba at 3 Dhara near Devprayag. Make sure to eat ample aloo paranthas, so that you can have food directly at Chopta after this. The distance from Haridwar to Kund is covered in the bus (300 Rs.) in approximately 7 hours. Once you reach Kund at around 12:30 pm, shared cabs (sumo) are available for Ukhimath (20 Rs.) and thereafter from Ukhimath to Chopta (50 Rs.) Depending on the luck with shared transport one should reach Chopta at 2 or 3 pm. Chopta is located on the Ukhimath to Gopeshwar route; Mandal village is around 24 kms from Chopta and is very scenic.

        Once you are near Duggalbitta, accommodation options in the form of camps, tents and small homestays start appearing. If you are coming by public transport, the best idea is to get down right at Chopta (where there are trek stairs to Tungnath temple.) During summer season, Ukhimath to Gopeshwar buses ply on this road and it is possible to reach Chopta by bus as well. (According to locals buses run twice a day.) Shared taxis from Ukhimath to Chopta are many and run from morning till at least 5 in the evening. 
        
        </p>

       <p> <b>Planning the trek </b>
It is most likely that one will reach Chopta by 2 to 3 pm (if the transport connection to and from Ukhimath works fine). Time taken to trek to Tungnath Temple from Chopta is usually 3 hours for an average person, and another one hour for Tungnath to Chandrashila. It can be classified as a fairly easy trek – on the difficulty level and can be ideal for a first time trekker.

Most people stay at Chopta, do a day hike to Tungnath and Chandrashila and come back the same day. It is possible to do it provided one leaves early, say by 7 am. It is best to reach Tungnath by 10, pay your respects at the temple and enjoy the scenery. Trek ahead to Chandrashila, come back by 1 pm. Eat lunch either near Tungnath temple or at the dhabas on the trail and start the walk back to Chopta. Remember that usually the time taken to go back is half of what you’d take while hiking up, so one can get back to Chopta in 2 hours from Chandrashila.
